Boundary data from Matt's regional 2km MITgcm is saved in /nobackupp/jwang23/projects/regional.mitgcm/BoundaryPropertiesForJinbo.mat 

Run post_analysis.py to analyze the energy flux in llc4320 through the three boundaries. It needs to be ran in the folder /home1/jwang23/nobackup/llc4320_stripe/ccs.boundary.4matt/data.

Now the IGW_energy_flux.py should work. Need to run p_flux() to check. 

Moved grid.tar into grid/
